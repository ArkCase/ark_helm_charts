# Each key is the NAME of the integration
#
# An empty value, the boolean value false, or the string value
# "false" will disable the integration.
#
# Any other value will enable it. If the value is anything other
# than the boolean value true, or the string "true", then it will
# be converted to a string, and used as the alternate key atop
# the configuration block within the arckase-server.yaml file
#
# The alternate key may contain dots, and the consequences of
# these dots are beyond the scope of this integration facility.
